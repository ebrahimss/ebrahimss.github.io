    summary: 'My research has concentrated on developing innovative applications within optimization and machine learning to solve complex issues across various sectors. They include using machine learning to enhance operational efficiencies in healthcare logistics, employing deep learning models for improving reliability and performance in supply chain management under variable conditions, and applying advanced algorithms for optimizing power flow in electrical grids with an emphasis on renewable energy sources. Additionally, I have developed a flexible Python-based tool aimed at boosting efficiencies in production systems.',

    summary: 'The project focused on optimizing patient transportation within healthcare facilities. From February to April 2022, patient flow data extracted and analyzed to identify inefficiencies and improve transport processes. The study highlighted missed pickup times, inefficient staff allocation, and potential areas for reducing wait times, such as ensuring patients are ready for transport beforehand. The project utilized statistical analysis and modeling to determine optimal staff requirements and schedules, aiming to enhance transport response times and minimize idle time for transporters. This research provides a systematic approach to streamline patient transport operations, thereby improving efficiency and patient satisfaction.',
